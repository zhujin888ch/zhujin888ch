<br> My name is Emilly(she/her). I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
<br> 🔭 Currently learning about data science, frontend and how to play among us.
<br> 🌱 I am passionate about contribuing, being part of a community (that's why i'm in so many...) and music.
<br> ⚡ Recently my projects are kid-related, while I am studying I find something nice to do for them.
